# DESCRIPTION
The Ride-Sharing App Prototype is an Android-based application designed to provide a seamless and efficient ride-hailing experience for users. This prototype focuses on real-time location tracking, ride requests, and driver details, allowing passengers to request rides and drivers to accept them in a simulated environment. The app is developed using Android Studio with Java, integrating Google Maps SDK for navigation and Firebase as the backend for managing real-time data.
The app is divided into two primary user roles: Passengers and Drivers. Passengers can request rides by entering their pickup and destination locations. They can also track their assigned driver's real-time location on a Google Map interface. Drivers, on the other hand, receive ride requests and can either accept or reject them based on availability. The Firebase Realtime Database ensures smooth data synchronization between passengers and drivers, allowing instant ride matching. The app also implements a user authentication system, enabling users to sign up and log in securely using Firebase Authentication.
